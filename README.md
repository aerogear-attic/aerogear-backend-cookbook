=========================

The AeroGear Backend cookbook is complementary to the client cookbooks. It holds all backend required to client recipes:

- [iOS cookbook](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-cookbook)
- [Android cookbook](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-cookbook)
- [JavaScript cookbook](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js-cookbook)
- [Cordova cookbook](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-cordova-cookbook)
- [Windows cookbook](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-windows-cookbook)

Each recipe is a complete mobile app. The goal of the recipes is to show you how easily you can use  AeroGear libraries.
